# Bruh.io-Custom
An original modification of the game https://bruh.io/ and http://surviv.io/. 

To-Do:
  1. Bots are moving randomly -> follow up with bots with path-planning algorithms(e.g. A*), Reinforcement Learning(probably will not converge...) and genetic algorithms. 
  2. Include graphics. 
  3. More items.
  4. Optimize code. 
  5. Make it into an online multiplayer game hosted on a server(hopefully!).
